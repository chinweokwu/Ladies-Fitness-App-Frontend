# Final Capstone Project: Homw Workouts

## Final Capstone Project - Find My Course

> In this final capstone project, I completed the following tasks:

- Use React and Redux to build a website where users can see lists of workouts and set a timer.
- Make external API requests to retrieve a list of workouts from the server.
- Store the retrieved API data in the `redux store`.
- Create and Remove notepads and calories only if a given user is authenticated.
- calculate calories lost
- Use the `React-Redux Hooks` and `React-Redux Saga` to fetch the workouts, calories lost and notepads data from the `redux store`.
- Use `axios`, a client HTTP API to make external API calls.
- Use the `redux-saga` middleware.
- use component styling
- create a reusable modal, card, carousel and timer component
